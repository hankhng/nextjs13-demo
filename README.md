Notes:

- When you npm run dev, the files will always be SSR
- The only way to test static generation is to npm run build && npm run start to see the effect of statically generated site
- Main reason to use client component is to allow user interactivity / stateful-ness / anything done on the browser / requires element to be binded to

// http://localhost:3000/search/Javascript
// "search" is the segment of the url
// "Javascript" is the leaf node of the url

https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/defining-routes#route-groups

- To organise routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. (marketing) or (shop)).
